Code and associated data for replicating main figures and key analyses from [GBE evae110](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae110).

Each numbered folder contains a script for a main analysis, in order as presented in the manuscript, sometimes with associated data files. All scripts use general data files found in ```z_dataFiles```.
